# KL-Partitioning
Min-cut partitioning a graph using kernighan Lin algorithm

KL algorithm is an old heuristic algorithm for partitioning a graph into two parts, 
with equal number of vertices in each part, and as small as possible number of cuts between the two parts.

Since it is a heuristic algorithm, the minimality is not guaranteed.

INPUT format
-------------

The first line specifies the number of nodes |V|, 
and the number of edges |E|

The nodes then are numbered 1 to |V|.
The following |E| lines specify edges

Note that there could be unconnected nodes, i.e.,
nodes not connected to any other nodes.
